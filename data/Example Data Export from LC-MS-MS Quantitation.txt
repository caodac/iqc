Subject: Example Data Export from LC-MS-MS Quantitation

Hello Trung and Ajit,
When we met to discuss informatics support for the IQ Consortium project, I promised to send you an example of the data export from the LC-MS-MS instrument so you could think about how to extract the key information.  An edited export file is attached. 
 
Format of the file:
For the final export file, the order of data will be:  analyte#1, analyte#2, albendazole (internal standard).  This should be repeated over and over about 190 times.  There will be 352 compounds per set and 6 controls.  For each set of data for each analyte, you will see blank, T0, T5, T10, T15, T30, T60 (which is for sampling times: 0, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes, respectively).  [This export file has a few instances where the same compound was repeated multiple times as part of my method development.]
 
Data extraction:
Forget about albendazole, since it is the internal standard.
1.       Extract: Compound name (which is on the header line for each data set, next to “Compound 1:” or “Compound 2:”).
2.       Extract:  Sample Time (which is under Sample Text, e.g., extract T5 and convert it to 5 min).
3.       Extract Response (which is the sample peak area divided by the IS peak area)
 
Data Processing:
1.       Plot Log Response (y axis) versus Linear Sample Time
2.       Fit the peaks by regression analysis and calculate the line’s slope
3.       Perform an analysis of each data point and reject points that are outside criteria.  For example, the compound may be depleted at later time points and the rate will not be linear, or one or more points may not be within some criteria of the line.  Tabulate such points.
4.       Recalculate without the rejected points.
5.       Prepare a table with entries of Compound and Slope.
6.       I will perform visual inspection of the data and plots and discard any poor data (e.g., the compound does not produce a sufficient LC-MS-MS signal about 10% of the time.)
 
There will likely be other “features” that would be nice to add later.  I’ll also work on defining any further processing of the Slope value to calculate a Rate value.  The order the samples appear may change from the current Blank, T60…..T0, to Blank, T0…..T60.
 
How does all that sound?  Please give me a call if you want to discuss it.  I’d be happy to come over to your office and look at everything together with you.
 
Many thanks,
Ed
