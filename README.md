This repository contains client and server code for the IQC Validator,
the software that supports automated analysis and curation of
high-throughput metabolic stability assay as part of a joint
collaboration between the [IQ Consortium](https://iqconsortium.org)
and [NCATS](https://www.ncats.nih.gov). For further information about
